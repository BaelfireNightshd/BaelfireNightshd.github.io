Some people may wonder how easy it is to start a blog, they then get into a world of wondering about hosting costs and managing a server to serve their blog pages. Very quickly they realize that this is probably going to be a more involved process. Well I also had this thought, but after seeing how much more work than just writing it can be, I started to wonder if that was the only way. My first thought, as a programmer, was to wonder if I could host it on [GitHub](https://github.com). To my surprise, there is already a way to make a blog hosted on github using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now). 

### Setting up Jekyll Now

The first thing you'll need is a [GitHub](https://github.com) account. GitHub is a website that hosts code for programmers. Itâ€™s free and it offers the ability to keep track of changes to code documents. (This is actually the main feature of GitHub technically, but it can be seen as an added benefit for hosting a blog)

After you've made an account and signed in, navigate to the [Jekyll Now repository](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now) and fork the repository by clicking the fork button in the top right corner. Doing this copies a blankish (it has some placeholder stuff) blog to your github account so that you can edit it and make it your own. 

Lastly, to give your blog it's own URL, click on the settings tab just under the repository path. Then find where you can rename your repository. You're going to change the name to something very specific. It'll be of the format `githubUserName.github.io`. As an example, mine is named `BaelfireNightshd.github.io`.
