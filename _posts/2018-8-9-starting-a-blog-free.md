title: How to Setup a Blog for Free
---

Some people may wonder how easy it is to start a blog, they then get into a world of wondering about hosting costs and managing a server to serve their blog pages. Very quickly they realize that this is probably going to be a more involved process. Well I also had this thought, but after seeing how much more work than just writing it can be, I started to wonder if that was the only way. My first thought, as a programmer, was to wonder if I could host it on [github](https://github.com). To my surprise, there is already a way to make a blog using github using [Jekyll Now](https://github.com/barryclark/jekyll-now).
